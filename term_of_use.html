2. Use License

Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information or software) on Rajni Gujarati’s website for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license, you may not:

- modify or copy the materials;

- attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained on Rajni Gujarati’s website;

- remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or

- transfer the materials to another person or “mirror” the materials on any other server.

This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by Rajni Gujarati at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of this license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession, whether in electronic or printed format.

3. Disclaimer

- Rajni Gujarati shall have no liability for conduct in relation to your use of the App. You may not use the App unless you are the copyright holder or you have obtained all necessary rights and licenses to use all images and other material that make up your creation on or via the App.

- The materials on Rajni Gujarati’s website are provided on an ‘as is’ basis. Rajni Gujarati makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties, including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.

- Further, Rajni Gujarati does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials on its website or otherwise relating to such materials or on any sites linked to this site.

4. Limitations

In no event shall Rajni Gujarati or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the App and the materials on Rajni Gujarati’s website, even if Rajni Gujarati or a Rajni Gujarati authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.

Rajni Gujarati does not warrant that any of the materials on its website are accurate, complete, or current.
